# Data Science CS109 HW1:Which of two things is larger?

Polling data isn't a perfect predictor for the future, and some polls are more accurate than others. This means that election forecastors must consider prediction uncertainty when building models.

In this first assignment, you will perform a simple analysis of polling data about the upcoming <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(United_States)">Governor races</a>. The assignment has three main parts:

**First** you will build some tools to download historical polling data from the web, and parse it into a more convenient format. 

**Next** you will use these tools to aggregate and visualize several past Governor races

**Finally** you will run a bootstrap analysis to estimate the probable outcome of current Governor races, given the level of precision of historical polls.
